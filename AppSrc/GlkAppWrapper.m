/* GlkAppWrapper.m: Class which manages the program (VM) thread
    for IosGlk, the iOS implementation of the Glk API.
    Designed by Andrew Plotkin <erkyrath@eblong.com>
    http://eblong.com/zarf/glk/
*/

/*  This class contains the VM thread, and the methods that synchronize it with the main (UI) thread.

    The portable Glk program runs in its own thread (which I'll refer to as "the VM thread", even if the program isn't a virtual machine per se). It has a simple lifecycle: it runs along for a while, and then it calls glk_select(). That blocks and waits for the UI thread to send some kind of input event. (Presumably a response to the input requests that the Glk program has made.) When an event arrives, the VM thread wakes up and processes it.

    The iowait flag indicates whether the VM thread is awake or asleep. It is set when the VM enters glk_select(); it is cleared when an input event arrives.

    Coordinating threads is always a headache, of course. We do all our synchronization using iowaitcond, an NSCondition variable. (NSConditions are also thread locks.) Any cross-thread variable -- principly iowait, but there are a handful of others -- may only be accessed while holding iowaitcond.

    Note, however, that the VM thread does not hold iowaitcond the whole time it is running. It leaves that free in normal operation. (The main thread sometimes grabs it to pass in information, such as window size changes that happen while the VM thread is awake.) The VM thread only takes iowaitcond when it is setting up a glk_select().
